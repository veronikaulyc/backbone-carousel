#backbone-carousel
Implementation of a simple backbone carousel
The carousel displays number of "showBlocks" on the screen,
previous and next buttons move number of "step" blocks forward or back accordingly.
Each block displays one image which is chosen randomly from the block array.
The structure of blocks is received from a server API (can be simulated by Postman), its structure is equal to the structure of source.json
